Scanning tiles
---------------

The scanner is a feature, which is integrated into the routine of loading. So we
take the animation of Rockford, for example. You paint an animation to move
Rockford to the left and then, if you load BoulderDaesh, it recognises, that you
have not painted the animation to move Rockford to the right. Now BoulderDaesh
copies the animation for the left and turns it around. This work also the other
way round.

The following blocks will be copied:

   Earth <=> Fake_Earth
   Metal <=> Fake_Metal <=> Metal_Moving_Block
   Stone <=> Stonie asleep
   Wall <=> Growing Wall left/right <=> Growing Wall up/down
   Rockford left <=> Rockford right  (all Animation-steps)
   Diamond_0 <=> Egg_0 <=> Egg_1 <=> Egg_2 <=> Egg_3

From each of these types, there must exist one of the equivalents. If there is a
type missing, than the requester sends the message: "Graphic incomplete"

   Out <=> Fake Out <=> In  (not only open, but also closed)

If there does not exist any type of In/Out, then the closed type consists of metal.

   IMPORTANT:

Each copy within a block cannot take place, if there is a pixel in it, which is
not the colour of the background.
Each block, which only consists of the colour of the background, is empty.
All block, which are not mentioned here, must be available to start the game.

5. Animations

For all animations there is space for eight steps. If you need less than eight
steps for your animation, please take a zero (colour of the background) for all
steps you do not need and the animation will be ended earlier. Please pay
attention the fact, that after an empty block all the other graphics of this
animation will be ignored.
