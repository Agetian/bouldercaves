@node "Epilepsy" "Epileptic seizure or altered consciousness"

@{MS "Epileptic seizure or altered consciousness"}

A very small percentage of people have a condition that causes them to epileptic
seizure or altered consciousness when exposed to certain light patterns or
flashing lights, including those that appear on a television screen and while
playing games. Such people may have no medical history of seizures or epilepsy.
Please take the following precautions to minimise any risk:

Prior to use:

ae If you, or anyone in your family, has ever had an epileptic condition or has
experienced altered consciousness when exposed to flickering light, consult your
doctor prior to playing.

ae Sit at least 2.5m (8 ft) away from the screen.

ae If you are tired or have not had much sleep, rest and commence playing only
after you are fully rested.

ae Make sure that the room in which you are playing is well lit.

ae Use the game on as small a television screen as possible (preferably 14" or
smaller).

During use:

ae Rest for at least 10 minutes per hour while playing a game.

ae Parents should supervise their children. If you or your child experiences any
of the following symptoms while playing: dizziness, altered vision, eye or
muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or
convulsions, discontinue use IMMEDIATELY and consult your doctor.

@node "Introduction" "Introduction"

@{MS "Introduction"}

BoulderDaesh is a convertation of the original BoulderDash from the good old C64.

You may say why another BoulderDash clone? You are right, there are a lot of clones,
but they are all not as good as the original, if you look at the graphic or the
feeling of playing it. Even converts at PC are not very good. Also on fast PCs
the animation speed of the objects is lowered, if there is scrolling.

My version was tested by different independent persons and all said the same:
This BoulderDaesh is the best. I will not praise myself here, but test it
yourself, built your own opinion and please tell @{"me" link "Author"} about it.

-------------
@node "Systemrequirements" "System Requirements"

@{MS "System Requirements"}

BoulderDaesh (should work) works on all Amigas with OS 2.0 or higher.

Some functions are not available under 2.0, because they presume OS3.x+
(MemoryPools,...)

Starting with OS2.1 BoulderDaesh is able to work multilingual.

If you want to use the additional buttons on your joypad then you`ll require the
lowlevel.library. (part of the Amiga-OS 3.1)

When using Amithlon, MorphOS or PCI Amigas you can also use my optional
lowlevel.library replacement. This allows the usage of the available GamePorts
on your system.

To run BoulderDaesh a minimum of 1MB is required. To use all features (Ingame
music and my internal music box) more memory is required.

If you want to use BoulderDaesh on graphic boards then Picasso96 or
CyberGraphics and a 68020 as minimum is required. I suggest a 68030-25Mhz as
minimum.

If you want to use BoulderDaesh with sound cards then AHI is
required.

In addition to that and the standard libraries nothing else is needed.

BoulderDaesh was tested with the following configurations without any
problems.

   A2000-30   OS3.1   1MB Chip and   8 MB Fast

The Official BoulderDaesh-CDROM

The contents of the original BoulderDaesh-CDROM isnaet Shareware! It`s not allowed
to copy the CD or part of it!

The shareware archive

This program may be published on every public medium, as long as all files in
the archive are unchanged. If this medium is a CD I expect a free copy.
(Aminet-CDs excluded)

I expect from everybody, who uses BoulderDaesh regularly, to @{"register" link "HOWTOREGISTER"}
immediatly. I think this does not hurt anybody, and I will have
more fun to integrate new features or write a new game.

Updates may be requested from Aminet.

I am not liable for injuries or data loss caused by BoulderDaesh. The use of
BoulderDaesh is your own responsibility !!!

@{MS "How to Install BoulderDaesh"}

To install BoulderDaesh please use the original Commodore Installer. It creates a
directory, in which BoulderDaesh is installed.

If you do not like BoulderDaesh, you can delete the whole drawer to destroy
BoulderDaesh completely.

Assigns, path-adjustments or insertments into the User-Startup are not
necessary. Only if you are so enthusiastic, that you want to start BoulderDaesh
in the User-Startup. (-8

@node "History" "History"

@{MS "History"}

This text shows like a diary, what has been changed in the different
versions.

@{MH "V1.00"}

1987 written at a weekend. It was my first programm at the A500!!! It was as
fast as the original, but it wasn't able to fasten the speed of the game. This
was optimised by more intelligent screen routines and an optimised move
controller. The levels were firmly integrated and there were never more than 3,
because otherwise I had to enter them in the source as "dc.b DT_Metal,DT_Wall..."

@{MH "V2.00"}

1995 a complete new version (changing of the routines), addition of a move
controller and an intelligent screen creation routine, that runs without Double
Buffering.

@{MH "V2.01"}

Addition of the LevelEditor, removement of some little bugs and adaption of the
Lowlevel library.

@{MH "V2.02"}

New routine for the falling of the stones with correct gravitation (for each
direction one)

@{MH "V2.03"}

Little corrections in the Interrupt Blitter Routine

@{MH "V2.04"}

Little corrections in the routine of the falling stones. Stones also tilt down
at the right side. (-8

@{MH "V2.05"}

New initialisation and less memory needed. With this step the weakest point,
concerning the stability of the system after ending BoulderDaesh was removed.
With the help of the asyncfunctions a GUI created, with is an interface between
the game and OS.

@{MH "V2.06"}

Local texts and new mistake requester

@{MH "V2.07"}

Scrolling mistake in oversized levels corrected.

@{MH "V2.08"}

Enlarged graphics in the LevelEditor and new random-functions.
Mistake (software failure) in the explosion of the twins corrected

@{MH "V2.09"}

Little mistakes by changing from big to small levels corrected.
Little corrections in the Game-Editor.
Protection-protocol included. Now you can't start my levels any more.

@{MH "V2.10"}

Graphic-interface included. From now on BoulderDaesh loads all graphics as
IFF-picture.

@{MH "V2.11"}

Graphic and animation-scanner included. All game settings can be saved. Pattern
in the ASL Requester. Paths and patterns will be saved in the game
settings.

@{MH "V2.12"}

The graphic is completely now. Water looks like water and the magic walls are
walls, that will be animated.

@{MH "V2.13"}

Little mistakes corrected : Joycontroller, time-out, LevelEditor

@{MH "V2.14"}

New gravitation arrows included

@{MH "V2.15"}

Bad bug under OS2.x corrected : Found by Andreas Vierkant

@{MH "V2.16"}

Small discrepancies with the original levels corrected and opting the
LevelCompressor.

@{MH "V2.17"}

Small changes in the LevelEditor and the window for the LevelSettings

@{MH "V2.18"}

Small bugs for the Icon Starting, the ASL-Requester and the LevelEditor
corrected: (reported by Timo Hegemann)

@{MH "V2.19"}

Water adjustment and slime rate changed to percent

@{MH "V2.20"}

Mistake in the number of players corrected. A player got a life to much indeed.
(-8

@{MH "V2.21"}

Addition of the highscorelist. Every game has its own highscores now.

@{MH "V2.22"}

Small mistakes in the NameRequester and in the Hiscore-Save-Routine corrected.
Play the game some times to fill the highscorelist.
The player names will be saved with the prefs now.

@{MH "V2.23"}

Again some mistakes in the highscore routines found. Furthermore a player with
the same score in the same level will be added in the highscores after the
player, who is already there.

@{MH "V2.24"}

Modulo mistake in the LevelEditor corrected. From time to time the levels were
distorted while depressing, if the running game contains a level , which was
bigger then the one to edited. small discrepancies with the levelnumbers
corrected. If you win in one game, for example, 20 levels and then also win the
last one, the game starts again at the beginning and the levelnumber was set to
1. This isn't good for your place in the highscores. Now the levelnumbers will
be counted on.

@{MH "V2.25"}

Besides some small optings in the LevelEditor you can play the edited level in
the testing mode endless, no difference, if you win the level or not. The level
will return. The Tilulit-Effect can be switched off specially for the
LevelEditor now.

@{MH "V2.26"}

Mistake in the LevelSetting requester corrected.

@{MH "V2.27"}

Mistake in the Scrollercontroller found, which appears in different level sizes
in one game.

@{MH "V2.28"}

Following the hint of Timo Hegemann a GameOver-Intercut after the last life was
added. Furthermore the long existing mistake in the scroller function was
corrected. Now you can always the entry of a cave, before Rockford
appears.

@{MH "V2.29"}

Game information requester added and making the game format safe for the
future.

@{MH "V2.30"}

New font routine added and creation of a font very similar to the original.
IFF-Loader, prefs requester and prefs format adjusted.
Mistakes in the magic wall corrected. New score line and game notices, which are
very similar to the original. Mistakes in the game information corrected.

@{MH "V2.31"}

Little corrections in the documentation and in the local data done.
Small graphical corrections in the LevelSetting requester done.
Mistake in the sounds giving out corrected. (reported by Andreas Vierkant)

@{MH "V2.32"}

Worked in the mistake of saving games. Now the game version number is also
counting. Small opting in the IFFILBM routines. GameSettings enlarged. Now you
can choose, which game will be loaded while starting BoulderDaesh. Now I have
found a mistake, which is also in the first Aminet Version. Every time the first
player is always announced. This gets a little bit difficult with two players in
the end of a game.

@{MH "V2.32"}

Small correction in the move controller. Now to original levels are more
compatible and the feeling is better. Now you can't explode through a left-right
movement under a stone by accident.

@{MH "V2.34"}

Changed the stone-falling routine. Now the stone fall 100% original.
Furthermore I have corrected the small disorientation of the LevelScoller at the
beginning of a new level.
Mistake in the time bonus corrected and adjustment of the bonus life function to
the original. Addition of the DoubleScan switch into the GameSettings. Now the
owners of screens, who can only show frequencies >30Khz, can play BoulderDaesh as
well.

@{MH "V2.35"}

Now the ChipSet will be resetted by LoadView(zero). Perhaps DoubleScan will run
now, too. 300 (threehundred) new levels in 15 games added. Perhaps some levels
are not playable, because the adjustment of the water/slime and the magic walls
is missing.

@{MH "V2.36"}

Water and slime routine corrected. Now the water grows constantly and the slime
is always pervious in the same way. Before this the rate falls by growing
quantity of water (slime). Mistake by creating Rockford corrected. One line
wasn't active because of a mistake in version 2.28 and hasn't been activated
again.
Mistake in the animationscroller of the magic wall corrected.
Bonus life effect included.
Changing water to diamonds by activating the magic wall included.
Timing-problem within the start of the level corrected.
The ghost-moving routine adjusted to the original. Now there are nearly no more
incompatibilities. "Nearly no more", because all BoulderDaeshs are different in
the movement partly.
A more efficient LevelCompressor included, which replaces the old one.

@{MH "V2.37"}

UserBlock finally included into the LevelEditor. Otherwise it would be
senseless.
The SpaceBlock can also be animated.
Mistakes in the scroller by starting the level corrected. The ghosts already
started moving while scrolling. So it could happen, that Rockford already
exploded while he is created, because Rockford waited for the scroller, but not
the ghosts.

@{MH "V2.38"}

Future-GFX included.
The animation speed can the adjusted via ToolType for every graphic font.
Mistake in the animation controller corrected.
New icons created.

@{MH "V2.39"}

ExplosionRoutine improved.
From now on all INs in a level will be supported. So all Rockfords coming out of
an IN can be moved.
Little improvements in the TwinRoutines.

@{MH "V2.40"}

Mistakes in the LevelScroller corrected, which only appears, if many Rockfords
appear.
Correction of a mistake by the creation of Rockford at the beginning of a level,
which only appears with many Rockfords.

@{MH "V2.41"}

Now all twins explode, if a ghost thoughs them.

@{MH "V2.42"}

Modification in the protection protocol. Now also in the level frames In and
Outs can be set.
Small mistakes in the explosion routine corrected. Rockford could still explode
in the Out.
New PlayerName requester in the GameSettings included.
Score texts are printed concentric automatically.
Now the PlayerName can be distributed in stead of Player# optionally.
Old name requester at the end of the game removed.
New Hiscore routines included. Now there are 3 different hiscorelists for every
game.
Mistake in the linkage of the windows corrected.
New LevelSetting requester included.
Mistake in the New routine found.

@{MH "V2.43"}

Very stupid mistake in the installer script found and removed.
Hiscore cycle gadget shows now only the three valid values.
Old @{"cheat" link "cheats"} removed and 3 new @{"cheats" link "cheats"}
added.

@{MH "V2.44"}

After you have started a game, the screen scrolls to a blinking block, the
@{"In" link "DT_In"}.

After some seconds it explodes. @{"Rockford" link "DT_Rockford"} appears here,
the hero of the game. It is possible to decrease this delay by moving the stick
in one direction.

His task is the following one: He has to collect a specific number of
@{"diamonds" link "DT_Diamond"} in a specific time and must then move to the
@{"Out" link "DT_Out"} to leave the level.

It is very simple. After @{"installing" link "HowToInstall"} BoulderDaesh the
default game (BDash_I_Level1.game) is selected. This game is a perfect beginner
game and it should explain any questions.


@{MS "Keyboard Functions"}

These brackets "[]" are describing the CD32 joypad buttons

With the cursorkeys you can move Rockford via keyboard. The keys Shift, Alt and
Amiga have the function of the firebutton.

If you get into a situation with no way out, you can blow up Rockford by pushing
the ESC-key [BLUE]. After each loss of Rockford it is the turn of the next
player. If you play alone, it is logically your turn.

Press the spacebar [PLAY/PAUSE] to activate and deactivate the pause.

You are able to return to the Workbench by using the help key. You can continue the
game at any time by pressing the @{"start game" link "MaiWStar"} within the main window.

Pressing left Amiga and "M" is like pressing help!

By pressing F1/F10 [GREEN and YELLOW together] you can leave the game
immediately and get back to the menu or leveleditor. There is no way to continue
the game !!!

The following keys are for the music player. For further information consult the
@{"music player" link "GaMu"} chapter.

Press the "M" key to cycle the music @{"playing mode" link "GaMuAuMo"}. These
playing modes are used: "Effects only", "Music only" , "Music and Effects".
Note: Depending on the module not all modes are available.

TAB together with F1 allows to grab the game/editor screen into t: drawer (only
available in RTG mode)

Both things only happen if they are not asleep. Stonies stay as long asleep as
the @{"stone" link "DT_Stone"} is without movement, so the @{"stone" link "DT_Stone"}
cannot fall down. A sleeping stonie acts like a normal @{"stone" link "DT_Stone"}
and can be pushed by @{"rockford" link "DT_Rockford"} as
well.

If Rockford crosses @{"ground" link "DT_Earth"}, afterwards there will be
@{"space" link "DT_Space"}. If you press the fire button, Rockford frees the
place next to him. He can remove one element @{"ground" link "DT_Earth"} in

@{"stonie" link "DT_Stonie"} horizontal next to Rockford and behind the
@{"stone" link "DT_Stone"} there is a @{"space" link "DT_Space"}, Rockford can
push this stone(-ghosts). With the fire button Rockford can push the @{"stone" link "DT_Stone"}

@{MS "Space - Background"}

This Element is only important, if you want to create own caves. If you are a
Player then skip this part.

Space - Background is always empty but @{"rockford" link "DT_Rockford"} is not
able to move through this element. Do not use this Block to create a labyrinth
or something like this, because the user (player) is able to select an other
graphic set via @{"game settings" link "GaSe"} and override your specified
graphic set. For example "FutureAmiga" this Block is empty, but the real
@{"space" link "DT_Space"} is full of stars.

What are this Blocks good for?

Since BoulderDaesh 3.0 and on a request by Thomas Sahling it is possible to
remove the Level border. If you define a level that looks like a Circle, than
you need something around. @{"spaces" link "DT_Space"} need cpu time, because
there is always an animation, even if you can not see this. In addition to that
space animations are not wished every time. Short: If you want to fill an area
with space and @{"rockford" link "DT_Rockford"} is not able to enter this area,
then use this block.

If this is not 100% clear then keep a look on the included level
"BoulderDaesh/Little.int".

-------------

@node "OwnGFX" "Own Graphic Sets"

@{MS "Own Graphic Sets"}

Beside the @{"included graphics" link "INCGFX"} you can create own graphics,
too. All you need is a paint program and some talent.

If you have created own graphics, you can send them to me and I will admit them
into my archive, after some testing.

All graphics of BoulderDaesh are Lores-IFF-pictures. Each picture consists of a
complete graphic. So load a picture and change the graphic then.

Some advice you should read first, because this advice can save you a lot of
annoyance and work.

1. picture size

The picture should have the loosening Lores with 8 or 256 colors and should not
consist of masks. BoulderDaesh should not have problems with other sizes, but
these pictures will need a lot of needless space on your hard disk. 256 Color
graphics are available in RTG Mode only. The first color is always black. Do not
modify colors 0 and 248-255. These colors are reserved for later use and may
change. If you want to create a graphic set that is OCS/ECS/AGA compatible 8
colors are the limit.

2. Block Size

Every block consists of 16*16 pixel.

3. The position of the single elements

The arrangement of the single blocks is very simple. So please look at the added
graphics. If you need a little help, please look at the
@{"Table" link "BlockPositionTable"}.

4. Scanner

The scanner is a feature, which is integrated into the routine of loading. So we
take the animation of Rockford, for example. You paint an animation to move
Rockford to the left and then, if you load BoulderDaesh, it recognises, that you
have not painted the animation to move Rockford to the right. Now BoulderDaesh
copies the animation for the left and turns it around. This work also the other
way round.

The following blocks will be copied:

   @{"Earth" link "DT_Earth"} <=> @{"Fake_Earth" link "DT_EarthFake"}
   @{"Metal" link "DT_Metal"} <=> @{"Fake_Metal" link "DT_MetalFake"} <=> Metal_Moving_Block
   @{"Stone" link "DT_Stone"} <=> @{"Stonie" link "DT_Stonie"} asleep
   @{"Wall" link "DT_Wall"} <=> @{"Growing Wall left/right" link "DT_GrowingWallLR"} <=> @{"Growing Wall up/down" link "DT_GrowingWallUD"}
   @{"Rockford" link "DT_Rockford"} left <=> Rockford right  (all Animation-steps)
   @{"Diamond_0" link "DT_Diamond"} <=> @{"Egg_0" link "DT_Egg"} <=> @{"Egg_1" link "DT_Egg"} <=> @{"Egg_2" link "DT_Egg"} <=> @{"Egg_3" link "DT_Egg"}

From each of these types, there must exist one of the equivalents. If there is a
type missing, than the requester sends the message: "Graphic incomplete"

   @{"Out" link "DT_Out"} <=> @{"Fake Out" link "DT_OutFake"} <=> @{"In" link "DT_In"}  (not only open, but also closed)

If there does not exist any type of In/Out, then the closed type consists of
metal.

   IMPORTANT:

Each copy within a block cannot take place, if there is a pixel in it, which is
not the colour of the background.

Each block, which only consists of the colour of the background, is empty.

All block, which are not mentioned here, must be available to start the
game.

5. Animations

For all animations there is space for eight steps. If you need less than eight
steps for your animation, please take a zero (colour of the background) for all
steps you do not need and the animation will be ended earlier. Please pay
attention the fact, that after an empty block all the other graphics of this
animation will be ignored.

6. Speed of the Animations

The speed for every animation can be adjusted. This is possible by adjusting of
the @{"Tooltypes" link "GFXToolTypes"} in the info-data of the particular
graphic-data.

7. The Colors

It is possible to create a colorful graphic set by using the
@{"Tooltypes" link "GFXToolTypes"} and the @{"ColorSetHandler" link "CoSH"}.

Characters, too. All you need is a paint program and some talent.

The font is formatted in Lores with 1 plan and should not be filed in another

@node "OwnSPL" "Own Sample Sets"

@{MS "Own Sample Sets"}

If you have an own sampler and adequate software, you can create own
@{"samples" link "INCSPL"} for your BoulderDaesh game.

Create a new drawer in the directory "SampleSets" and copy your samples to this
drawer. In the @{"Game Settings" link "GaSe"} you can now choose your sample
sets and you can hear your own samples while playing.

But you must pay attention to some important things:

1.The samples must be in IFF 8SVX format. This shouldn't be a problem, because
nearly every software generates this format. for Amiga it is the most used
format.

2."Diamond" and "TimeOut" should sound right for c octave 2. For the MED sampler
this adjustment is default. C-2 corresponds to a hardware period of "428".

3.BoulderDaesh also realizes which samples do exist. This are the supported
sounds and their qualities:

ae "LevelIn"-Sound and "LevelOut"-Sound depend on each other. So if one of them
doesn't exist, it will be replaced by the other one. This means, that after
collecting the last needed diamond the "LevelIn"-Sound appears, if you don't
have a "LevelOut"-Sound.

ae "StonePush"-Sound is also replaced by the "Stone"-Sound, if it doesn't
exist.

ae "GravitationArrow"-Sound is also replaced by the "Collect"-Sound, if it
doesn't exist.

At the moment BoulderDaesh supports following sounds:

        "Explosion.SND"         (I don't know (-8 )
        "Stone.SND"             (Stone falls)
        "Diamond.SND"           (Diamond falls)
        "TimeOut.SND"           (TimeOut Sound)
        "Dig_Space.SND"         (Digging through space)
        "Dig_Earth.SND"         (Digging through earth)
        "Water.SND"             (is played cyclic)
        "MillingWall.SND"       (is played cyclic)
        "Collect.SND"           (Rockford collects a Diamond)
        "LevelIn.SND"           (Rockford appears into the level)
        "LevelOut.SND"          (collection of the last needed diamond)
        "StonePush.SND"         (sound for pushing)
        "StonePushFailed.SND"   (sound for failed push)
        "GravitationArrow.SND"  (ONLY if gravitation changed by Grav.arrow)
        "Background.SND"        (is played cyclic)

The names of the sounds must be written right. Otherwise BoulderDaesh doesn't
find them.

Create a drawer on your hard disk. e.g "games:BoulderDaesh". Now you must add the
following line to your user-startup:

Assign BoulderDaesh: games:BoulderDaesh

After restarting your system you are able to play the game like you ever did,

@node "FAQUpdCD" "FAQ - Is it possible to update a CD version?"
@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "Is it possible to update a CD version?"}

You are playing BoulderDaesh direct on CD and you want to update this CD by a
normal Boulderdaesh update archive? This would save much hard disk space?

No Problem! There is no specific CD required. Just the Archive should be stored
decrunched on CD. (Crunched is also possible by using the ARC handler, but this
is for experts only)

Install your update on hard disk. After installaiton add the following ToolType
to the icon of the BoulderDaesh main program. (Of cource on hard disk.)

AddPath=CDName:Path/BoulderDaesh

After the equal the position of the BoulderDaesh-drawer on your CD is reuired.
Only specify the boulderDaesh-drawer and not the BoulderDaesh file. Your
should also remove the @{"BoulderDaesh:" link "FAQInstCD"}-assign, if
you had created one.

An other possible way is to assign "BoulderDaesh:" via user-startup:

Assign BoulderDaesh: CDName:Path/BoulderDaesh Path

I recomment the first version, because this user-startup assign uses memory even
if you are not playing BoulderDaesh.

After these adjustments it is required to start BoulderDaesh always from hard
disk to run the newest version. The CD is also always required.

-------------
@node "FAQDoesnotCompute" "FAQ - BoulderDaesh does not run!"
@toc "FAQS"

BoulderDaesh needs some libraries, which are added at the original Workbench.

-------------
@node "FAQMultitasking" "FAQ - After playing a while BoulderDaesh denies keyboard usage!"
@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "After playing a while BoulderDaesh denies keyboard usage!"}

This problem effects non RTG mode only, but if you are using a Joypad then
you should also read the @{"joypad chapter" link "FAQJoypad"}!!

BoulderDaesh is running in multitasking since version 3.56! This may cause
problems, because BoulderDaesh is using the blitter hardware very intensive (up
to 11000 blitter copies each second (NTSC 13200)), so there is no time for
system blitter action.

If the operating system is trying to use the blitter it is going to sleep until
the blitter is free. BoulderDaesh is using the input.device for keyboard input
and if the OS is sleeping there is not device activity. The point is, that you
MUST stop all programmes that open/close windows or use the graphics.library
(blitter) in any way.

In the most cases these programmes are Workbench Eyes, Clock tools and of course

@{MS "FAQ - The keyboard control is not very useful!"}

On slow systems it may happen, that the AmigaOS has not enough time to process
the keyboard handling. In this cases the keyboard input is delayed and a good
gameplay is impossible. There is no way to avoid this, because this is a step
back.

The joystick control is always working perfect.

@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "FAQ - The Joypad is not working correct!"}

Well! Make sure that the lowlevel.libary is installed! Without BoulderDaesh is
using the Pad like a Joystick!

It may take a while, after first using the lowlevel.library. The autodetection
may take a few seconds. Just move around until @{"rockford" link "DT_Rockford"}
is moving. If nothing happens something goes very wrong. This is not a
BoulderDaesh bug.

Note: Just try to plug your JoyPad into the other port. BoulderDaesh is detecting
it when using the lowlevel.library. Without lowlevel.library the normal joystick
port will be used.

But there is a problem when using the lowlevel.library. On some systems the
joypad isnaet working correct.

It is very easy to describe the problem! The additional buttons (GREEN, YELLOW,
PLAY, REVERSE, FORWARD)) arenaet working! Actually they are working when
combined.

Currently it seems that only ECS Systems are effected. If there are additional
problems on other maschines let @{"me" link "Author"} know.

@{MS "FAQ - How can I speed up the game?"}

Graphic board

If you are using a graphic board you should set the screen dimensions to
320*200. Most boards should work fine if you only disable the @{"fullscreen" link "GaSRFSGa"}
option. This should be enough to get full speed when using a
68030/25Mhz. A faster computer should be able to allow bigger screens.

Without graphic board

Generaly you should @{"disable RTG" link "GaSRRRTG"} to get maximum speed. If
you simply want to check out RTG, or just want to use more than 8 colors, then
you should reduce the screen dimensions to 320*200 and 8 colors. Some graphic
sets (e.G.Classic#?) allow the usage of 4 colors.

@{MS "Memory problems on game start, but the level editor works fine!"}

This problem effects non RTG mode only!!

This is all right. BoulderDaesh needs in a game the field size of the biggest
level and allocats this right at the beginning. If you edited in the Editor a
size of 40*22, so there also can be a level with 40*40 in the same game. And in
your case for this size there isn't ChipMem free. Try to close windows and
screens to save ChipMem. If this doesn't help, quit BoulderDaesh and restart it,
because of this ChipMem will be defragmented. If this also doesn't help, remove
the big level from the game.

contain this special @{"out" link "DT_OutBlinking"}.

ae The selected graphic set contains no @{"out" link "DT_OutBlinking"} animation.
The included graphics are supporting full animation.

But there is an additional reason why the blinking is missing:

This problem effects RTG mode only!!

It may happen that your computer is to slow to update the screen 50 times a
second. The out animation in the most cases contains 2 animation phases only
(open/close). If the screen update requires more than 1/50 second each second
animation phase will be skipped, so it stays closed.

Beside the BoulderDaesh game format BoulderDaesh is able to load a lot of
additional file formats. There is no special import function. Just load them an
BoulderDaesh autodetects the file format. Please note that non of the formats
below can be written:

@{MS "C64 Construction Kit Caves and Intermissions"}

These are the most used files around. In the most case the files are named with ".int" or ".cav" as suffix.
These files contain complete levels. The ".int" files are 1/4 sized ".cav" files used as bonus live intermissions in
the original gane.

@{MS "Atari Construction Kit Caves and Intermissions"}

Like the C64 format but this time from atari.

@{MS "C64 Construction Kit Game - List Format"}

This file type (".gam") is used by the C64 Construction Kit and only contains a list of level names. Normaly they are 898
bytes long, but sometimes they appear a little longer (1016)

If you want to load your old creations, then make sure the cave are in the same directory with your ".gam" suffixed file.

@{MS "C64 Construction Kit Game - Level Format"}

This file was created by the C64 game editor. It's a simple linked list of normal C64 cave files at a boundary of 0x200. The filesize can be
up to 10242 which are 20 levels at max. Well, BoulderDaesh can handle longer files as well, just in case.

@{MS "BoulderDaesh Game - List Format"}

Like the C64 boulderdash, BoulderDaesh is able to read a game file type which contains only a list of levels to load.

You can create these files by hand. Here is a little example how to make a simple game
from the Boulderdaesh example levels:

echo "BoulderDaesh LevelList*n" to T:MyGameFile.game
list BoulderDaesh:Caves/BoulderDaesh/#? lformat "%f%n" >>T:MyGameFile.game sort n files

The first line creates the identification header. The second line creates one
single level for each level including it's path and file name. It's possible to
add comment lines by starting the line with ";". Empty lines are also possible.

@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "What is a Chunk?"}

Amigas IF-Format (IFF) is very special. For example a picture is seperated in
different sections called: Chunk!

Each section is defined by a 4 byte name, like "BODY". The "BODY" chunk contains
only the pixel map of a picture. In a sound file this "BODY" contains the RAW
sample. The "CMAP" contains only colors. And so on. For each Type of data there
is a CHUNK.

The cheat is that there are no restrictions what chunk and how many chunks are
included in one file. So it is possible to include sounds within a
picture.

But what is a paint programm doing when loading a picture containing audio
information? Well it is searching for picture information, so it is only reading
the "ILBM" section, with means aePictureae. The other unknown data (e.g. "8SVX" =
Sample) will be ignored.

BoulderDaesh is using this feature to store additional color information within

This Gadget is very important. It specifies how BoulderDaesh is keeping graphic,
character and sample sets, while you are not playing:

["In game" and "game start" mean the started game/starting the game and not
starting the program "BoulderDaesh" via Workbench/CLI.]

"off":

The data sets are always lost and must be loaded at every game start. You should
activate this option only, if you haven't very much memory, or you create @{"own graphic sets" link "OwnGFX"},
@{"own sample sets" link "OwnSPL"} or @{"own character sets" link "OwnCHR"}. This is necessary, because BoulderDaesh is
loading the actual data sets every time from disk or harddisk.

"only needed":

If this option is activated, BoulderDaesh is holding all data sets, needed to
play the actual game.

"all":

BoulderDaesh is holding all data sets in memory. With enough memory, this option
rejects most disk access, because all datas are already in memory.

The reached level is more important than the amount of score. If you reach level

is shown, that the player has reached with that life, that he leaves the
level.

@node "GFXToolTypes" "Tooltypes of the Graphic Set Files"

@{MS "The Tooltypes of the Graphic Set Files"}

At the moment the following tooltypes will be supported. In brackets there are
the default values, that are used, if no tooltypes are found.


Speed Tooltypes

    "Speed_ManRight"      (1)
    "Speed_ManLeft"       (1)
    "Speed_BonusLive"     (1)
    "Speed_MagicWall"     (2)
    "Speed_Diamond"       (2)
    "Speed_In"            (10)
    "Speed_Out"           (10)
    "Speed_FakeOut"       (10)
    "Speed_DiamondGhost"  (2)
    "Speed_Ghost"         (3)
    "Speed_Stonie"        (7)
    "Speed_Water"         (7)
    "Speed_Slime"         (7)
    "Speed_MovingBlock"   (1)
    "Speed_UserBlock"     (3)
    "Speed_Space"         (1)

These tooltypes need a value from 0 to 255. These values are the delay time. The
higher this value is the slower will be the animation.

   Examples:

   Speed_Slime=4
   Speed_MovingBlock=2

ColorSet Tooltype

    "ColorSet"            (none)

This tooltype defines the source of the @{"BDMP" link "CoSH"}-Chunk. This chunk
contains the level colors. Under normal conditions the colors are saved within
the graphic set. By using this tooltype you are able to define an other file as
source.

Why is this needed? Well, letaes have a look on the "ClassicC64Pumpkin.gfx"
graphic set. This file isnaet containing any color set. If you take a look at the
tooltypes you will find this: "ColorSet=ClassicC64.gfx".

This makes color set editing much easier, because you edit one color set and all
graphic sets are using the colors automaticaly.

An other useful thing is that the ColorSet-tooltype is looking for the @{"BDMP" link "CoSH"}-Chunk
only. This is very handy when making graphic set changes and
saving the picture by using a paint programm. Under normal conditions the colors
will be lost during the save procedure, but if you use the @{"ColorsetHandler" link "CoSH"}
you are able to create a stand alone color set file. The only thing
you must do is to specify this color set file by using the "colorSet"-tooltype.
Note: It is required that the colorset file is saved within one of the
"GraphicSets" subdirectories.

Please read the chapter @{"ColorSetHandler" link "CoSH"} to understand the
color set handling. This may save time and avoids frustration.

-------------
@node "MUSToolTypes" "Tooltypes of the Music Files"

@{MS "The Tooltypes of the Music Files"}

At the moment the following tooltypes will be supported. In brackets there are
the default values, that are used, if no tooltypes are found.

    "MixedMode"           (0)
    "IgnoreJump"          (If not specified this mode is disabled)

The Voices are specified as follows:

   Voice 1   = 1
   Voice 2   = 2
   Voice 3   = 4
   Voice 4   = 8

If your music is not using Voice 1 and 3 you should specify "MixedMode=5" to
allow BoulderDaesh to use this voices for sound effects.

"IgnoreJump" is used for musics that contain an intro. At the end of such music
there is a jump command (bxx) that specifies a position right after the intro.
If one music is played endless (Continue/Random mode), then use this tooltype to
disable this jump.

   Example:

   IgnoreJump=3

BoulderDaesh ignores a B03-jump command.

-------------
@node "TITLEToolTypes" "The Tooltypes of the Title Screen"

@{MS "The Tooltypes of the Title Screen"}

At the moment the following tooltypes will be supported. In brackets there are
the default values, that are used, if no tooltypes are found.

   Eye_X              (10)
   Eye_Y              (10)
   Eye_Width          (64)
   Eye_Height         (17)
   Foot_X             (10)
   Foot_Y             (10)
   Foot_Width         (64)
   Foot_Height        (17)
   Music              (TitleClassic.mus)
   RTGTitlePrefs      (RTGTitlexxx.Prefs)

The X and Y values are the destination position for the elements. (pixel)
Note: The ECS mode allows only X coordinates and width that are factors
of 8. (e.G 12 => 8) Within the RTG mode all coordinatinates are available.

The height is limitated. Valid are values 1 to 17.

The music tooltype specifies the music for this picture. This entry must not
have a path.

"RTGTitlePrefs" is specifying the RTG preferences name for title picture screen
mode.This entry must not have a path, too.

@node "Technical" "Technical information about BoulderDaesh"

@{MS "Technical information about BoulderDaesh"}

BoulderDaesh is 100% assembler coded.

The sourcecode take more than 1455084 bytes in 146 files. BoulderDaesh is
assembled with DevPac 3.04. DevPac needs 40 seconds and 2.35 MB each time.

The game source files are taking 5572526 bytes in 8853 files and 54 directories.
My personal game converter needs 13 Minutes to convert all games.

The first versions of BoulderDaesh were created on an A500-000/7Mhz (2.8 MEG)
then (Version 2) on an A2000-000/7Mhz (5 Meg). Since version 3.0 I'am working
with an A2000-030/25Mhz (9 MEG). Since version 5.00 I am working on Amithlon
Pentium3 866Mhz (128MB) which reduces the assembling time to 2 seconds.

The paint program PPaint (4.0/6.4) was used to create graphic sets and title
graphics. I wrote this guide using GoldEd (3.x/4.x) and his fantastic fold
features.

-------------
@node "OtherPrgs" "Other programs!"

   @{MS "Other programs!"}
   @{MS "BoulderDaesh   [game/jump/boulderdaesh.lha]"}

Clone of the original Boulderdaesh for Amiga. It is the only version running faster on Amiga than the
