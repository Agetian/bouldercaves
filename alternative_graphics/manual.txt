@{MS "Epileptic seizure or altered consciousness"}

A very small percentage of people have a condition that causes them to epileptic
seizure or altered consciousness when exposed to certain light patterns or
flashing lights, including those that appear on a television screen and while
playing games. Such people may have no medical history of seizures or epilepsy.
Please take the following precautions to minimise any risk:@{PAR}

@{b}Prior to use:@{ub}@{PAR}

° If you, or anyone in your family, has ever had an epileptic condition or has
experienced altered consciousness when exposed to flickering light, consult your
doctor prior to playing.@{PAR}

° Sit at least 2.5m (8 ft) away from the screen.@{PAR}

° If you are tired or have not had much sleep, rest and commence playing only
after you are fully rested.@{PAR}

° Make sure that the room in which you are playing is well lit.@{PAR}

° Use the game on as small a television screen as possible (preferably 14" or
smaller).@{PAR}

@{b}During use:@{ub}@{PAR}

° Rest for at least 10 minutes per hour while playing a game.@{PAR}

° Parents should supervise their children. If you or your child experiences any
of the following symptoms while playing: dizziness, altered vision, eye or
muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or
convulsions, discontinue use @{b}IMMEDIATELY@{ub} and consult your doctor.

@{MS "Introduction"}

BoulderDäsh is a convertation of the original BoulderDash from the good old C64.@{PAR}

You may say why another BoulderDash clone? You are right, there are a lot of clones,
but they are all not as good as the original, if you look at the graphic or the
feeling of playing it. Even converts at PC are not very good. Also on fast PCs
the animation speed of the objects is lowered, if there is scrolling.@{PAR}

My version was tested by different independent persons and all said the same:
This BoulderDäsh is the best. I will not praise myself here, but test it
yourself, built your own opinion and please tell @{"me" link "Author"} about it.

@endnode
@node "Systemrequirements" "System Requirements"

@{MS "System Requirements"}

BoulderDäsh (should work) works on all Amigas with OS 2.0 or higher.@{PAR}

Some functions are not available under 2.0, because they presume OS3.x+
(MemoryPools,...)@{PAR}

Starting with OS2.1 BoulderDäsh is able to work multilingual.@{PAR}

If you want to use the additional buttons on your joypad then you`ll require the
lowlevel.library. (part of the Amiga-OS 3.1)@{PAR}

When using Amithlon, MorphOS or PCI Amigas you can also use my optional
lowlevel.library replacement. This allows the usage of the available GamePorts
on your system.@{PAR}

To run BoulderDäsh a minimum of 1MB is required. To use all features (Ingame
music and my internal music box) more memory is required.@{PAR}

If you want to use BoulderDäsh on @{b}graphic boards@{ub} then Picasso96 or
CyberGraphics and a 68020 as minimum is required. I suggest a 68030-25Mhz as
minimum.@{PAR}

If you want to use BoulderDäsh with @{b}sound cards@{ub} then AHI is
required.@{PAR}

In addition to that and the standard libraries nothing else is needed.@{PAR}

BoulderDäsh was tested with the following configurations without any
problems.@{PAR}

@{MS "History"}

This text shows like a diary, what has been changed in the different
versions.

@{MH "V1.00"}

1987 written at a weekend. It was my first programm at the A500!!! It was as
fast as the original, but it wasn't able to fasten the speed of the game. This
was optimised by more intelligent screen routines and an optimised move
controller. The levels were firmly integrated and there were never more than 3,
because otherwise I had to enter them in the source as "dc.b DT_Metal,DT_Wall..."

@{MH "V2.00"}

1995 a complete new version (changing of the routines), addition of a move
controller and an intelligent screen creation routine, that runs without Double
Buffering.

@{MH "V2.01"}

Addition of the LevelEditor, removement of some little bugs and adaption of the
Lowlevel library.

@{MH "V2.02"}

New routine for the falling of the stones with correct gravitation (for each
direction one)

@{MH "V2.03"}

Little corrections in the Interrupt Blitter Routine

@{MH "V2.04"}

Little corrections in the routine of the falling stones. Stones also tilt down
at the right side. (-8

@{MH "V2.05"}

New initialisation and less memory needed. With this step the weakest point,
concerning the stability of the system after ending BoulderDäsh was removed.
With the help of the asyncfunctions a GUI created, with is an interface between
the game and OS.

@{MH "V2.06"}

Local texts and new mistake requester

@{MH "V2.07"}

Scrolling mistake in oversized levels corrected.

@{MH "V2.08"}

Enlarged graphics in the LevelEditor and new random-functions.@{PAR}
Mistake (software failure) in the explosion of the twins corrected

@{MH "V2.09"}

Little mistakes by changing from big to small levels corrected.@{PAR}
Little corrections in the Game-Editor.@{PAR}
Protection-protocol included. Now you can't start my levels any more.

@{MH "V2.10"}

Graphic-interface included. From now on BoulderDäsh loads all graphics as
IFF-picture.

@{MH "V2.11"}

Graphic and animation-scanner included. All game settings can be saved. Pattern
in the ASL Requester. Paths and patterns will be saved in the game
settings.

@{MH "V2.12"}

The graphic is completely now. Water looks like water and the magic walls are
walls, that will be animated.

@{MH "V2.13"}

Little mistakes corrected : Joycontroller, time-out, LevelEditor

@{MH "V2.14"}

New gravitation arrows included

@{MH "V2.15"}

Bad bug under OS2.x corrected : Found by Andreas Vierkant

@{MH "V2.16"}

Small discrepancies with the original levels corrected and opting the
LevelCompressor.

@{MH "V2.17"}

Small changes in the LevelEditor and the window for the LevelSettings

@{MH "V2.18"}

Small bugs for the Icon Starting, the ASL-Requester and the LevelEditor
corrected: (reported by Timo Hegemann)

@{MH "V2.19"}

Water adjustment and slime rate changed to percent

@{MH "V2.20"}

Mistake in the number of players corrected. A player got a life to much indeed.
(-8

@{MH "V2.21"}

Addition of the highscorelist. Every game has its own highscores now.

@{MH "V2.22"}

Small mistakes in the NameRequester and in the Hiscore-Save-Routine corrected.@{PAR}
Play the game some times to fill the highscorelist.@{PAR}
The player names will be saved with the prefs now.

@{MH "V2.23"}

Again some mistakes in the highscore routines found. Furthermore a player with
the same score in the same level will be added in the highscores after the
player, who is already there.

@{MH "V2.24"}

Modulo mistake in the LevelEditor corrected. From time to time the levels were
distorted while depressing, if the running game contains a level , which was
bigger then the one to edited. small discrepancies with the levelnumbers
corrected. If you win in one game, for example, 20 levels and then also win the
last one, the game starts again at the beginning and the levelnumber was set to
1. This isn't good for your place in the highscores. Now the levelnumbers will
be counted on.

@{MH "V2.25"}

Besides some small optings in the LevelEditor you can play the edited level in
the testing mode endless, no difference, if you win the level or not. The level
will return. The Tilulit-Effect can be switched off specially for the
LevelEditor now.

@{MH "V2.26"}

Mistake in the LevelSetting requester corrected.

@{MH "V2.27"}

Mistake in the Scrollercontroller found, which appears in different level sizes
in one game. 

@{MH "V2.28"}

Following the hint of Timo Hegemann a GameOver-Intercut after the last life was
added. Furthermore the long existing mistake in the scroller function was
corrected. Now you can always the entry of a cave, before Rockford
appears.

@{MH "V2.29"}

Game information requester added and making the game format safe for the
future.

@{MH "V2.30"}

New font routine added and creation of a font very similar to the original.@{PAR}
IFF-Loader, prefs requester and prefs format adjusted.@{PAR}
Mistakes in the magic wall corrected. New score line and game notices, which are
very similar to the original. Mistakes in the game information corrected.

@{MH "V2.31"}

Little corrections in the documentation and in the local data done.@{PAR}
Small graphical corrections in the LevelSetting requester done.@{PAR}
Mistake in the sounds giving out corrected. (reported by Andreas Vierkant)

@{MH "V2.32"}

Worked in the mistake of saving games. Now the game version number is also
counting. Small opting in the IFFILBM routines. GameSettings enlarged. Now you
can choose, which game will be loaded while starting BoulderDäsh. Now I have
found a mistake, which is also in the first Aminet Version. Every time the first
player is always announced. This gets a little bit difficult with two players in
the end of a game.

@{MH "V2.32"}

Small correction in the move controller. Now to original levels are more
compatible and the feeling is better. Now you can't explode through a left-right
movement under a stone by accident.

@{MH "V2.34"}

Changed the stone-falling routine. Now the stone fall 100% original.@{PAR}
Furthermore I have corrected the small disorientation of the LevelScoller at the
beginning of a new level.@{PAR}
Mistake in the time bonus corrected and adjustment of the bonus life function to
the original. Addition of the DoubleScan switch into the GameSettings. Now the
owners of screens, who can only show frequencies >30Khz, can play BoulderDäsh as
well.

@{MH "V2.35"}

Now the ChipSet will be resetted by LoadView(zero). Perhaps DoubleScan will run
now, too. 300 (threehundred) new levels in 15 games added. Perhaps some levels
are not playable, because the adjustment of the water/slime and the magic walls
is missing.

@{MH "V2.36"}

Water and slime routine corrected. Now the water grows constantly and the slime
is always pervious in the same way. Before this the rate falls by growing
quantity of water (slime). Mistake by creating Rockford corrected. One line
wasn't active because of a mistake in version 2.28 and hasn't been activated
again.@{PAR}
Mistake in the animationscroller of the magic wall corrected.@{PAR}
Bonus life effect included.@{PAR}
Changing water to diamonds by activating the magic wall included.@{PAR}
Timing-problem within the start of the level corrected.@{PAR}
The ghost-moving routine adjusted to the original. Now there are nearly no more
incompatibilities. "Nearly no more", because all BoulderDäshs are different in
the movement partly.@{PAR}
A more efficient LevelCompressor included, which replaces the old one.

@{MH "V2.37"}

UserBlock finally included into the LevelEditor. Otherwise it would be
senseless. @{PAR}
The SpaceBlock can also be animated.@{PAR}
Mistakes in the scroller by starting the level corrected. The ghosts already
started moving while scrolling. So it could happen, that Rockford already
exploded while he is created, because Rockford waited for the scroller, but not
the ghosts.

@{MH "V2.38"}

Future-GFX included.@{PAR}
The animation speed can the adjusted via ToolType for every graphic font.@{PAR}
Mistake in the animation controller corrected.@{PAR}
New icons created.

@{MH "V2.39"}

ExplosionRoutine improved.@{PAR}
From now on all INs in a level will be supported. So all Rockfords coming out of
an IN can be moved.@{PAR}
Little improvements in the TwinRoutines.

@{MH "V2.40"}

Mistakes in the LevelScroller corrected, which only appears, if many Rockfords
appear.@{PAR}
Correction of a mistake by the creation of Rockford at the beginning of a level,@{PAR}
which only appears with many Rockfords.

@{MH "V2.41"}

Now all twins explode, if a ghost thoughs them.

@{MH "V2.42"}

Modification in the protection protocol. Now also in the level frames In and
Outs can be set.@{PAR}
Small mistakes in the explosion routine corrected. Rockford could still explode
in the Out.@{PAR}
New PlayerName requester in the GameSettings included.@{PAR}
Score texts are printed concentric automatically.@{PAR}
Now the PlayerName can be distributed in stead of Player# optionally.@{PAR}
Old name requester at the end of the game removed.@{PAR}
New Hiscore routines included. Now there are 3 different hiscorelists for every
game.@{PAR}
Mistake in the linkage of the windows corrected.@{PAR}
New LevelSetting requester included.@{PAR}
Mistake in the New routine found.

@{MH "V2.43"}

Very stupid mistake in the installer script found and removed.@{PAR}

Space - Background is always empty but @{"rockford" link "DT_Rockford"} is not

@{"space" link "DT_Space"} is full of stars.@{PAR}

What are this Blocks good for?@{PAR}

Since BoulderDäsh 3.0 and on a request by Thomas Sahling it is possible to
remove the Level border. If you define a level that looks like a Circle, than
you need something around. @{"spaces" link "DT_Space"} need cpu time, because
there is always an animation, even if you can not see this. In addition to that
space animations are not wished every time. Short: If you want to fill an area

then use this block.@{PAR}

@node "OwnGFX" "Own Graphic Sets"

@{MS "Own Graphic Sets"}

Beside the @{"included graphics" link "INCGFX"} you can create own graphics,
too. All you need is a paint program and some talent.@{PAR}

If you have created own graphics, you can send them to me and I will admit them
into my archive, after some testing.@{PAR}

All graphics of BoulderDäsh are Lores-IFF-pictures. Each picture consists of a
complete graphic. So load a picture and change the graphic then.@{PAR}

Some advice you should read first, because this advice can save you a lot of
annoyance and work.@{PAR}

1. picture size@{PAR}

The picture should have the loosening Lores with 8 or 256 colors and should not
consist of masks. BoulderDäsh should not have problems with other sizes, but
these pictures will need a lot of needless space on your hard disk. 256 Color
graphics are available in RTG Mode only. The first color is always black. Do not
modify colors 0 and 248-255. These colors are reserved for later use and may
change. If you want to create a graphic set that is OCS/ECS/AGA compatible 8
colors are the limit.@{PAR}

2. Block Size@{PAR}

Every block consists of 16*16 pixel.@{PAR}

3. The position of the single elements@{PAR}

The arrangement of the single blocks is very simple. So please look at the added
graphics. If you need a little help, please look at the
@{"Table" link "BlockPositionTable"}.@{PAR}

4. Scanner@{PAR}

The scanner is a feature, which is integrated into the routine of loading. So we
take the animation of Rockford, for example. You paint an animation to move
Rockford to the left and then, if you load BoulderDäsh, it recognises, that you
have not painted the animation to move Rockford to the right. Now BoulderDäsh
copies the animation for the left and turns it around. This work also the other
way round.@{PAR}

The following blocks will be copied:@{PAR}

   @{"Earth" link "DT_Earth"} <=> @{"Fake_Earth" link "DT_EarthFake"}@{PAR}
   @{"Metal" link "DT_Metal"} <=> @{"Fake_Metal" link "DT_MetalFake"} <=> Metal_Moving_Block@{PAR}
   @{"Stone" link "DT_Stone"} <=> @{"Stonie" link "DT_Stonie"} asleep@{PAR}
   @{"Wall" link "DT_Wall"} <=> @{"Growing Wall left/right" link "DT_GrowingWallLR"} <=> @{"Growing Wall up/down" link "DT_GrowingWallUD"}@{PAR}
   @{"Rockford" link "DT_Rockford"} left <=> Rockford right  (all Animation-steps)@{PAR}
   @{"Diamond_0" link "DT_Diamond"} <=> @{"Egg_0" link "DT_Egg"} <=> @{"Egg_1" link "DT_Egg"} <=> @{"Egg_2" link "DT_Egg"} <=> @{"Egg_3" link "DT_Egg"}@{PAR}

From each of these types, there must exist one of the equivalents. If there is a
type missing, than the requester sends the message: "Graphic incomplete"@{PAR}

   @{"Out" link "DT_Out"} <=> @{"Fake Out" link "DT_OutFake"} <=> @{"In" link "DT_In"}  (not only open, but also closed)@{PAR}

If there does not exist any type of In/Out, then the closed type consists of
metal.@{PAR}

   @{b}IMPORTANT:@{PAR}

Each copy within a block cannot take place, if there is a pixel in it, which is
not the colour of the background.@{PAR}

Each block, which only consists of the colour of the background, is empty.@{PAR}

All block, which are not mentioned here, must be available to start the
game.@{ub}@{PAR}

5. Animations@{PAR}

For all animations there is space for eight steps. If you need less than eight
steps for your animation, please take a zero (colour of the background) for all
steps you do not need and the animation will be ended earlier. Please pay
attention the fact, that after an empty block all the other graphics of this
animation will be ignored.@{PAR}

6. Speed of the Animations@{PAR}

The speed for every animation can be adjusted. This is possible by adjusting of
the @{"Tooltypes" link "GFXToolTypes"} in the info-data of the particular
graphic-data.@{PAR}

7. The Colors@{PAR}

It is possible to create a colorful graphic set by using the
@{"Tooltypes" link "GFXToolTypes"} and the @{"ColorSetHandler" link "CoSH"}.

@{MS "Own Sample Sets"}

If you have an own sampler and adequate software, you can create own
@{"samples" link "INCSPL"} for your BoulderDäsh game.@{PAR}

Create a new drawer in the directory "SampleSets" and copy your samples to this
drawer. In the @{"Game Settings" link "GaSe"} you can now choose your sample
sets and you can hear your own samples while playing.@{PAR}

But you must pay attention to some important things: @{PAR}

1.The samples must be in IFF 8SVX format. This shouldn't be a problem, because
nearly every software generates this format. for Amiga it is the most used
format.@{PAR}

2."Diamond" and "TimeOut" should sound right for c octave 2. For the MED sampler
this adjustment is default. C-2 corresponds to a hardware period of "428".@{PAR}

3.BoulderDäsh also realizes which samples do exist. This are the supported
sounds and their qualities:@{PAR}

° "LevelIn"-Sound and "LevelOut"-Sound depend on each other. So if one of them
doesn't exist, it will be replaced by the other one. This means, that after
collecting the last needed diamond the "LevelIn"-Sound appears, if you don't
have a "LevelOut"-Sound.@{PAR}

° "StonePush"-Sound is also replaced by the "Stone"-Sound, if it doesn't
exist.@{PAR}

° "GravitationArrow"-Sound is also replaced by the "Collect"-Sound, if it
doesn't exist.@{PAR}

        "Explosion.SND"         (I don't know (-8 )@{PAR}
        "Stone.SND"             (Stone falls)@{PAR}

        "TimeOut.SND"           (TimeOut Sound)@{PAR}
        "Dig_Space.SND"         (Digging through space)@{PAR}
        "Dig_Earth.SND"         (Digging through earth)@{PAR}
        "Water.SND"             (is played cyclic)@{PAR}
        "MillingWall.SND"       (is played cyclic)@{PAR}
        "Collect.SND"           (Rockford collects a Diamond)@{PAR}
        "LevelIn.SND"           (Rockford appears into the level)@{PAR}
        "LevelOut.SND"          (collection of the last needed diamond)@{PAR}
        "StonePush.SND"         (sound for pushing)@{PAR}

        "GravitationArrow.SND"  (ONLY if gravitation changed by Grav.arrow)@{PAR}

Beside the @{"included modules" link "INCMUS"} you can create your own game
music, too. All you need is a ProTracker compatible music editor and some

If you have created own module, you can send them to me and I will admit them

After creating a music you must specify unused or not so important voices via

@{b}This problem effects non RTG mode only, but if you are using a Joypad then
you should also read the @{"joypad chapter" link "FAQJoypad"}!!@{ub}@{PAR}

BoulderDäsh is running in multitasking since version 3.56! This may cause
problems, because BoulderDäsh is using the blitter hardware very intensive (up
to 11000 blitter copies each second (NTSC 13200)), so there is no time for
system blitter action.@{PAR}

If the operating system is trying to use the blitter it is going to sleep until
the blitter is free. BoulderDäsh is using the input.device for keyboard input
and if the OS is sleeping there is not device activity. The point is, that you
MUST stop all programmes that open/close windows or use the graphics.library
(blitter) in any way.@{PAR}

In the most cases these programmes are Workbench Eyes, Clock tools and of course
awakener tools.@{PAR}

It may take a while, after first using the lowlevel.library. The autodetection

BoulderDäsh bug.@{PAR}

Note: Just try to plug your JoyPad into the other port. BoulderDäsh is detecting
it when using the lowlevel.library. Without lowlevel.library the normal joystick
port will be used.@{PAR}

This is all right. BoulderDäsh needs in a game the field size of the biggest
level and allocats this right at the beginning. If you edited in the Editor a
size of 40*22, so there also can be a level with 40*40 in the same game. And in
your case for this size there isn't ChipMem free. Try to close windows and
screens to save ChipMem. If this doesn't help, quit BoulderDäsh and restart it,
because of this ChipMem will be defragmented. If this also doesn't help, remove

    "Speed_Space"         (1)@{PAR}

These tooltypes need a value from 0 to 255. These values are the delay time. The
higher this value is the slower will be the animation.@{PAR}

   Examples:@{PAR}

   Speed_Slime=4
   Speed_MovingBlock=2@{PAR}

@{b}ColorSet Tooltype@{ub}@{PAR}

    "ColorSet"            (none)@{PAR}

This tooltype defines the source of the @{"BDMP" link "CoSH"}-Chunk. This chunk
contains the level colors. Under normal conditions the colors are saved within
the graphic set. By using this tooltype you are able to define an other file as
source.@{PAR}

Why is this needed? Well, let´s have a look on the "ClassicC64Pumpkin.gfx"
graphic set. This file isn´t containing any color set. If you take a look at the
tooltypes you will find this: "ColorSet=ClassicC64.gfx".@{PAR}

This makes color set editing much easier, because you edit one color set and all
graphic sets are using the colors automaticaly.@{PAR}

An other useful thing is that the ColorSet-tooltype is looking for the @{"BDMP" link "CoSH"}-Chunk
only. This is very handy when making graphic set changes and
saving the picture by using a paint programm. Under normal conditions the colors
will be lost during the save procedure, but if you use the @{"ColorsetHandler" link "CoSH"}
you are able to create a stand alone color set file. The only thing
you must do is to specify this color set file by using the "colorSet"-tooltype.
@{b}Note: It is required that the colorset file is saved within one of the
"GraphicSets" subdirectories.@{ub}@{PAR}

@{b}Please read the chapter @{"ColorSetHandler" link "CoSH"} to understand the
color set handling. This may save time and avoids frustration.@{ub}

@node "Technical" "Technical information about BoulderDäsh"

@{MS "Technical information about BoulderDäsh"}

BoulderDäsh is 100% assembler coded.@{PAR}

The sourcecode take more than 1455084 bytes in 146 files. BoulderDäsh is
assembled with DevPac 3.04. DevPac needs 40 seconds and 2.35 MB each time.@{PAR}

The game source files are taking 5572526 bytes in 8853 files and 54 directories.
My personal game converter needs 13 Minutes to convert all games.@{PAR}

The first versions of BoulderDäsh were created on an A500-000/7Mhz (2.8 MEG)
then (Version 2) on an A2000-000/7Mhz (5 Meg). Since version 3.0 I'am working
with an A2000-030/25Mhz (9 MEG). Since version 5.00 I am working on Amithlon
Pentium3 866Mhz (128MB) which reduces the assembling time to 2 seconds.@{PAR}

The paint program PPaint (4.0/6.4) was used to create graphic sets and title
graphics. I wrote this guide using GoldEd (3.x/4.x) and his fantastic fold
features.

@node "OtherPrgs" "Other programs!"

   @{MS "Other programs!"}
   @{MS "BoulderDäsh   [game/jump/boulderdaesh.lha]"}

Clone of the original Boulderdäsh for Amiga. It is the only version running faster on Amiga than the
original. It looks and behaves like the original. I was asked, where the C64 is. (-8 And all this on
a 68000 without Fastmem.

   @{MS "SimpleCat   [dev/misc/simplecat.lha]"}

This tool is for programmers and user. Using this program you can change catalogs of programs with

   @{MS "Afind   [util/misc/afind.lha]"}

With this program you can search for programs on your Aminet CDs in the easiest way. It is the same
than the original tool on the CD, but here you can use AminetCDs and AminetSets mixed. So you are
not forced to search for a program on the first 5 Aminet CDs, that is on AminetSet1 Disc b.

   @{MS "AView   [util/misc/aview.lha]"}

AView is a great multiview enhancement/replacement! It is working like Multiview, but you are able
to specify a special viewer/player for each file type.

good in reading templates.

   @{MS "DVBControl   [comm/misc/dvbcontrol.lha]"}

DVBControl is a software project for the Nokia MediaMaster (D-Box) and DVB2000 firmware. It allows
to update firmware, edit channel settings and much more. So if you are using DVB2000 and an Amiga
DVBcontrol is your only choice!

   @{MS "MCControl   [hard/hack/mccontrol.lha]"}

MCControl (MemoryCard Control) is a card reader for Playstation MemoryCards. It requires a little
self made hardware (~$5) and the free software!

   @{MS "TrackDisplayClock   [util/time/trackdisplaycl.lha]"}

A hardware track display is very useful, if you need it! The most time this type of hardware is only
good for lighting up the room! This will be changed when using TrackDisplayClock! TrackDisplayClock
displays the system time on your track display! Its cool, its useful and of course the time is
always in visual range. Delete all programs using screens, windows or icons to display the time and
of course don't forget to remove your noclick tool! TrackDisplayClock is doing all these jobs and
your system will be faster than before! (-8
